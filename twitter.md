Hi! If you're on this page, it's probably because you came from [my Twitter account](https://www.twitter.com/morisy). I'm the founder of non-profit investigative news site and FOIA tool [MuckRock](https://www.muckrock.com/). Since 2010, MuckRock has helped thousands file public records and FOIA requests at all levels of government, helping expose waste, unlawful surveillance, and leading to reforms at all levels of government. Based in Cambridge, MuckRock works with journalists, researchers, and activists across the country to make government more transparent and democracies more informed.

I'm also the content director for [ITPro](http://windowsitpro.com/), one of the web's leading destinations for IT news, analysis, and expert advice.

Previously, I was a John S. Knight Journalism Fellow at Stanford University, and I served as an editor at the Boston Globe, where I launched the paper's tech vertical BetaBoston.

I can be contacted at m@morisy.com ([PGP Key](https://keybase.io/morisy)) or via Signal at 650-656-3417. Please do not call unsolicited.
