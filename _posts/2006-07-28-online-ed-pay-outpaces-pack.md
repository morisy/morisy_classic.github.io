<a href="http://www.cyberjournalist.net/news/003641.php" target="_blank">Cyber Journalist</a> reports that a survey done by the Inland Press Association shows online editor pay saw a "8.1 percent increase in base pay from 2005 to 2006, and an 8.8 percent increase in total direct pay, which consists of salary and incentives, according to the NICS."

By comparison, overall newspaper pay increased by just 2.58 percent, and the AP <a href="http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/businesstechnology/2003157656_payraise28.html" target="_blank">reports</a> that the national payraise averaged 3.6 percent during that time period.
