By subtly weaving, rather than force-feading, multimedia elements into the story, Vanity Fair <a href="http://www.vanityfair.com/features/general/060801fege01" target="_blank">reconstructs</a> the NORAD defense scramble after Sept. 11, Lost Remote <a href="http://www.nowbreaking.com/?p=209" target="_blank">notes</a>. They call the piece "a simple and elegant integration."

They also note that it didn't require the creation of new material, just the selective use of original sources: more transparency and more immediacy for not a lot of extra effort.
