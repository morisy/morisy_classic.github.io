<p>When it comes to coffee, I've never been a huge <a href="http://www.starbucks.com/" target="_blank">Starbucks</a> fan. Why pay $4 a drink when you can pay $15 bucks, cut the sugar, and brew your own for a month?

When I do go to Starbucks, dragged along with a friend, I try and make my order as quick and painless as possible. I guess I'm just a <a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=89225418" target="_blank">Dunkin' Donuts kinda guy</a> in that respect.

But I do love a good caffeine fix, and when I heard talk of the <a href="http://www.rationalsurvivability.com/blog/?p=853" target="_blank">Hoffachino</a>, I had to at least give it a try. Here's the recipe from inventor <a href="http://www.rationalsurvivability.com/blog/?p=853" target="_blank">Christopher Hoff's website</a> (some Starbuckese removed, my personal preference):
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Venti Starbucks Doubleshot on ice</li>
<li>6 shots</li>
<li>3 Splenda</li>
<li>No syrup</li>
<li>1/2 and 1/2</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
The first time I ordered, it took about 6 confirmations with the barista and I was worried the order would <i>still</i> be messed up, but my fears were for naught. Six shots of espresso have never gone down so easy, and within about two minutes I'd polished that $3.68 (tax included!) worth of heaven off.

I also had a minor stroke, but the fact I only slept 30 minutes the night before had become irrelevant, so all-in-all a fair trade off.

<b>Verdict:</b> Must try. Particularly if you've given up sleep.
