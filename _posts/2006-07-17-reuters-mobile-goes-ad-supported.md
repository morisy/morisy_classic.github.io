<a href="http://mobile.reuters.com/" target="_blank">Reuters Mobile</a> is going completely ad-supported, <a href="http://www.paidcontent.org/reuters-mobile-to-move-to-ad-supported-in-us-new-mobile-site" target="_blank">reports</a> PaidContent. According to the article, "it is sponsored exclusively by HP, promoting its new line of color laser printers." Too bad the ads have what appears to be a <a href="http://ad.m-adx.com/web/3585/18595/xhtmltemplate.jsp?tracked-params=&link-id=606&adspace-id=3586&session-id=a5e7adcf-cf78-47e4-8a00-f5c8628ea0b1&rdtype=click&buyid=18616&creative-id=18380&zip=&kw=&format=xhtml" target="_blank">bad link</a>.

<b>Update:</b>There is an <a href="http://www.moconews.net/reuters-mobile-to-move-to-ad-supported-in-us-new-mobile-site.html" target="_blank">interview</a> about the move with Stephen Smyth, VP of Emerging Media for Reuters at MoCoNews.

That site also has the following:
<i>The company is working with Third Screen Media, the mobile ad vendor, and will include capabilities including where advertisers can capture users phone numbers, email addresses, provide store location finders, and utilize click-to-call capabilities.</i>
