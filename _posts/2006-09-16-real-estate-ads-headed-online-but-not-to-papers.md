<quote> No less startling, the majority of those real estate advertisers who are shifting their ad dollars online are not spending them on newspaper web sites. Those dollars are going to independent sites dedicated to snatching home buyers and sellers.</quote>

From <a href="http://www.medialifemagazine.com/artman/publish/article_7112.asp" target="_blank">Media Life</a>. A recent study also stated that realtors are switching simply because they feel that print classifieds are simply not effective when homebuyers themselves are switching to sortable, searchable database solutions.
