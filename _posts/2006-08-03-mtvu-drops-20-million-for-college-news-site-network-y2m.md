Here's the <a href="http://biz.yahoo.com/prnews/060802/nyw102.html?.v=64" target="_blank">press release</a>, plus the PaidContent digest <a href="http://www.paidcontent.org/viacoms-mtvu-to-acquire-online-campus-newspaper-network-y2m" target="_blank">here</a>.

Y2M currently hosts about 450 college papers, reaching over 5 million students. Y2M's college-site subsidiary, College Publisher, had recently acquired New Digital Media group, making it a near monopoly in college paper site hosting. MTVu, MTV's 24-hour online college network, has promised that "new online features will come available to the affiliates."
