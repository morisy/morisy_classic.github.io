Journalism 2.0 Mark Briggs has an excellent guest post from Scott Porad on <a href="http://www.journalism20.com/blog/2009/07/23/what-can-journalism-learn-from-i-can-has-cheezburger/" target="_blank">lessons for journalists from ICanHasCheeseburger</a>, which is perhaps the world's greatest repository of LOLcat pictures.

What's a LOLcat? Here:
<span class="inline inline-center"><a href="http://icanhascheezburger.com/2009/03/09/funny-pictures-dating-lolcat-confirmed/"><img src="http://morisy.com/files/images/funny-pictures-these-kittens-may-have-firefox-as-a-mother.jpg" alt="LOLcat" title="LOLcat"  class="image image-_original " width="500" height="412" /></a><span class="caption"><strong>LOLcat</strong></span></span>
As a general rule I hate LOLcats, but I'll make an exception in this case because Porad (who's on <a href="http://twitter.com/scottporad" target="_blank">Twitter</a>, by the way) makes some really great points about why <a href="http://icanhascheezburger.com/" target="_blank">ICanHasCheeseburger.com</a> and the company's growing number of similar sites (<a href="http://failblog.org/" target="_blank">FailBlog</a>, <a href="http://faildogs.com/">FailDogs</a>, etc. etc.) are success. 

In <a href="http://www.journalism20.com/blog/2009/07/22/the-catch-with-user-generated-content/" target="_blank">Porad's own words</a>:
<blockquote>
Compared to traditional humor and entertainment media companies, by relying on user-generated content to harness the wit and intelligence of our community, Cheezburger has found a way to acquire content at a lower cost. This is a significant competitive advantage for us. At the same time, thanks to the power of crowd-sourcing, the content is higher in quality and more relevant than what we could create on our own.

But there’s a catch: the important lesson from Cheezburger’s success with user-generated content is that while content costs less, it is not free. That is, even though we do not pay our users for the content they contribute, there is still a cost associated with acquiring and managing that content. Why? Because only a fraction of the content submitted to us is of high enough quality to be used.</blockquote>
He then discusses the expense around curating the material, which is not insubstantial, and offers suggestions on applying that curation to journalism.

Nothing new, but a nice reminder that even when journalists are ready to throw open the floodgates to user-generated content (UGC), a lot of work must happen to make it successful.
