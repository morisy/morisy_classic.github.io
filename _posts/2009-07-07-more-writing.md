Over the past several years, I've been published in a variety of publications large and small, including the <a href="http://nytimes.com/">New York Times' website</a>, <A href="http://cornellalumnimagazine.com/index.php" target="_blank">Cornell Alumni Magazine</a>, and <i>Business 2.0</i> magazine.

<p>Mostly, however, I have been writing full time for TechTarget, and you can read <a href="http://morisy.com/recentTechTargetArticles">my recent articles here</a>. You can also read the front page <a href="http://www.pulitzer.org/archives/7125">editorial I wrote</a> as a New York Daily News intern (it was part of a Pulitzer Prize-winning series). I've saved my <a href="http://delicious.com/morisy/morisy_clips+Cornell_Alumni_Magazine" target="_blank">Cornell Alumni Magazine links on Delicious</a>, where you can read the full articles.

<h2>Video</h2>
I also occasionally shoot and edit video for Boston International, like these pieces on <a href="http://vimeo.com/3092857">Endeavor Global</a> and the <a href="http://vimeo.com/3278263">Acumen Fund</a>, two microfinance organizations. Here I'm previewing and <a href="http://searchmobilecomputing.techtarget.com/video/0,297151,sid40_gci1339201,00.html">unboxing an Android G1 phone</a>, as part of my work at TechTarget:</p>

<h2>Contributing Author</h2>
<span class="inline inline-right"><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Untangling-Ivy-League-College-Prowler/dp/1596585005"><img src="http://morisy.com/files/images/untangling.jpg" alt="" title=""  class="image image-preview " width="156" height="209" /></a></span>I've been a contributing author on a number of guides and books, including <a href="http://searchnetworking.bitpipe.com/detail/RES/1235046269_901.html" target="_blank">The Ultimate Guide to Gaining Control of the WAN</a> (<i>Note: Requires Registration</i>) and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Untangling-Ivy-League-College-Prowler/dp/1596585005" target="_blank">Untangling the Ivy League</a>.

The latter, which I worked on with author <a href="http://marczawel.com/" target="_blank">Marc Zawel</a> while he was my managing editor at the <i>Sun</i>, has been cited as "the real lowdown on campus life" by the <i>New York Times</i> and the "antidote to the Princeton Review doldrums" by the <i>Boston Globe</i>.

I also briefly guest blogged for <a href="http://www.ivygateblog.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Ivy Gate</a>, a fact Google has never let me forget.
