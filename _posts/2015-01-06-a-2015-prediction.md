<p>John Herrman is one of my favorite media writers, generally because it can so precisely diagnose vague maladies I feel in the media landscape. <a href="http://www.theawl.com/2015/01/some-2015-predictions">His 2015 predictions are no exception</a>, though maybe it's ironic that this was one of my favorite bits:</p>
<blockquote><p>No human, for the entirety of 2015, will be convinced of anything but his own rightness by any “explainer” site. They will become extremely popular, fully stocked with “Perfect Response” and “Reasons Why” posts that are first and foremost affirming to the reader, and secondarily intended to demonstrate the rightness and virtue of the sharer. One high-growth post-type in 2015: “You’re Right, But For Even Better Reasons Than You Think.”</p></blockquote>
