Occasionally, logging in to check site comments, I get scary red text like this. It gives me a sick little thrill, realizing how complicated and interconnected everything is, that I can reach in and <i>break</i> stuff on this site, even accidentally, like opening up a mechanical watch and seeing all the gears and springs quietly clicking and <i>whirr</i>ing along.

Complexity is a beautiful and frightening thing.
