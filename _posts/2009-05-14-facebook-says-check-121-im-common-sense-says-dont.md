Since I've already gotten two of the spam Facebook messages today, I figure other people probably are, too. What sets this phishing attack from others? For one, no obvious misspellings:
<blockquote>
John Doe sent you a message.

Subject: Hello

"Check 121.im"

Pretty much identical to a regular Facebook message:
<blockquote>
John Doe sent you a message.

Great to see you the other day. The artist that I was trying to think of was Thomas Barbey:

Tricky, particularly since Facebook doesn't automatically use SSL encryption (manually go to the more secure version at <a href="https://www.facebook.com">http<b>s</b>://www.facebook.com</a>, and many browsers will display a green indicator in the address bar to let you know you're at the legit location).

Still, it's a good reminder that avoiding phishing traps is easy: Always, always, always look at the address bar when you enter your password and username for <em>any</em> website, whether it's a bank, social networking site, or e-mail. Even if only a trivial account is compromised, many users use the same passwords across all their logins, meaning big trouble even if it's the most clueless script kiddie who gets your data.

<b>Update:</b><i> Facebook has acknowledged the virus, and is taking steps to thwart its effects, the L.A. Times reports. 

<i>"This is a phishing attack. We’re well aware of it and are already blocking links to these new phishing sites from being shared on Facebook," <a href="http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/technology/2009/05/151im-yet-another-facebook-malwarewormvirusbugphishing-attack.html">Facebook e-mailed the LA Times</a>. "We’re also cleaning up phony messages and Wall posts and resetting the passwords of affected users. We think this is related to the fbaction.net/fbstarter.com campaign of a couple weeks ago. "

<i>Facebook has also put a <a href="http://blog.facebook.com/blog.php?post=81474932130">better anti-phishing blog post</a> than mine on preventing attacks, though it would be nice (if expensive to them) to make SSL the default connection.</i>

<p><b>Update 2:</b> Removed some Real Life (TM) first names I'd accidentally left in, to protect the innocent and guilty.
