There's a whole lot wrong with the idea of <a href="http://paidcontent.co.uk/article/419-the-wow-paywall-what-newspapers-can-learn-from-orcs-and-dwarves/">news as a video game</a>, but there's probably a whole lot more right at this point. <a href="http://twitter.com/psmith/">Patrick Smith</a> does a smart summary of some key concepts, including <b>people will pay for interaction</b>, <b>new as gaming</b> and <b>reader rewards</b>. It's all stuff I thoroughly believe in, but it's just not as inspiring as trust, justice and the American way, you know?

Patrick also has a blog post that <a href="http://psmithjournalist.com/2010/01/why-news-publishing-could-learn-from-video-games-developers/">lambasts papers for giving away updates</a>: Why create an iPhone app that just drives marginal traffic when, in theory, you could make it a profit center?
