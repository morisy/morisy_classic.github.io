<p>I can't remember a piece of media thinking I've enjoyed as much as <a href="http://tinyletter.com/melodykramer">Mel's Sandbox</a> by Melody Joy Kramer. The above is just a line she used her her latest epistle, and I think it captures what I've always wanted in my media: To make me think in new ways. It's why I've always hated most columnists and almost all cable commenters, even those I agree with: They don't expand my world.</p>
<p>The most gratifying, surprising aspect of MuckRock had been discovering amazing people who use the site to explore questions I never even would have thought to ask. They make me think in new ways, and hopefully the community we're building helps them think in new ways, too.</p>
<p>Anyway, <a href="http://tinyletter.com/melodykramer">subscribe to Mel's newsletter</a>.</p>
