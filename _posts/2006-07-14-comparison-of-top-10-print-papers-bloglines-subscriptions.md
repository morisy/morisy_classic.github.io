I decided to take the numbers* of print editions and compare them to a small percentage of online "subscribers,**" in this case public Bloglines subscriptions. First time, so I might not have subscribed to the largest feeds, subscriber-wise:

<table border = "1">
<tr>
<td>USA TODAY</td>      <td>2,272,815</td><td>6,533</td></tr><tr>
<td>Wall Street Journal</td>   	<td>2,049,786 </td>   <td>1,246</td>  </tr><tr>
<td>New York Times 	</td>          <td>1,142,464 </td>   <td>3,793</td>  </tr><tr>
<td>Los Angeles Times 	</td>  <td>851,832   </td>   <td>60</td> </tr><tr> 
<td>Washington Post 	</td>  <td>724,242    </td>  <td>744***</td> </tr><tr> 
<td>New York Daily News 	</td>  <td>708,477 </td>     <td>117</td>  </tr><tr>
