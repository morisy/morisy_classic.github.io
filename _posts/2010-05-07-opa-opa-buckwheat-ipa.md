From <a href="http://www.opaopabrewing.com/brews.html">Opa-Opa Brewing Company's website</a>:
<blockquote> This beer is brewed for those who appreciate the pure pleasure of the Hop. The malt comes through, but its not long before the hops take over! Aromatic, bitter and a bit strong, this beer graduated from the more is better school.</blockquote>

Highly recommended.
