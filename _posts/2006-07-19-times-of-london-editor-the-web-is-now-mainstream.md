But Robert Thomson adds newspapers aren't going away:

<i>"Not in my lifetime. Newspapers will have to justify their existence, with energy, creativity and integrity, but ink on paper is a pleasure to read and is a convenient format. Each newspaper is customized by each of its readers -- there has been much drivel talked about the Daily Me for the past decade or so. ... Each reader reads the Times in a different way, and adjusts the time spent according to her or his taste in subjects.</i>

This all from an <a href="http://www.iwantmedia.com/people/people59.html" target="_blank">Iwantmedia.com interview</a>. Romenesko <a href="http://www.poynter.org/column.asp?id=45&aid=104858" target="_blank">highlights</a> the reasons why print isn't going anywhere (too) soon.

Other points:
<ul><li>Says that though the steady income of subscriptions versus newstand buys is nice, but makes papers risk averse. "Being risk averse is not an option in the contemporary content environment."</li>
<li>Thomson tends to paint the print paper as great advertising for the web counterparts, especially with his paper's U.S. edition hitting more newstands.</li></ul>
