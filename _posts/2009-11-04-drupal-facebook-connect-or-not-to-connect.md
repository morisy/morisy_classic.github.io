<a name="continued"></a>Well, Drupal just so happens to have an excellent <a href="http://drupal.org/project/fbconnect">Facebook Connect module</a>, that just so happens to work great. I managed to get it working within just a few minutes on this very site (you can check it out here: <a href="http://www.morisy.com/user">http://www.morisy.com/user</a>).

I really like the module for a number of reasons:
<ul><li>Unlike <a href="http://disqus.com/">Disqus</a>, the commenting service I've long been wary of, the Drupal Facebook connect module creates a *local* user, and I control how that user is administered, I keep a local copy of their comments, and <b>my</b> site controls how that data is used, not a third party</li>
<li>It's simpler than OpenAuth, OpenID and other federated login systems. I love the idea, but implementations are just plain confusing. On a site dedicated to homeless issues, we have to assume a low level of tech savvy (this complexity might change soon with <a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2009/11/cutting-back-on-your-long-list-of.html">Google making a big push on usability</a>).</li>
<li>It works. I would say "It just works," but a Drupal forums user pointed me to the <a href="http://drupal.org/project/issues/fbconnect?categories=All">bug queue</a>. Are there issues? Absolutely, but I'm willing to quash them as they come up for the sake of usability.</a>
</ul>

Now, when I eventually want to upgrade to a more generic module that accepts Facebook, Google, and whatever else you can throw at it ... That's when I expect some issues. But that will be another day.
