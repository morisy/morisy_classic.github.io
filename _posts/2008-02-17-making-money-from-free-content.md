Working on a business plan to monetize your content? Kevin Kelly has some words of advice. He has posted an essay on making money from <a href="http://www.edge.org/3rd_culture/kelly08/kelly08_index.html">copyable content</a>, particularly in finding differentiators that can't be copied. In bullet forms, his main suggestions:

<ul>
<li>Immediacy</li>
<li>Personalization</li>
<li>Interpretation</li>
<li>Authenticity</li> 
<li>Accessibility</li> 
<li>Embodiment</li> 
<li>Patronage</li>
<li>Findability</li>
</ul>

<p>I think his core lesson is more important though, and could be summarized <em>What works today, won't work tomorrow. What works tomorrow, won't work the day after</em>. While the media half life was hundreds of years for print, decades for radio and television, it's going to get much, much shorter. Economic models will change as fast as the medium, and so trying to come up with "one strategy" is going to get you left behind.

<p>Kevin Kelly has a blog, <a href="http://www.kk.org/thetechnium/index.php">The Technium</a>, that's now in my Bloglines.
