I've been tempted lately to start a <A href="http://www.tumblr.com/" target="_blank">Tumblr</a> called "Things I Hate But I Love." For one, it's the perfect Tumblr name, in an <a href="http://thingsiatethatilove.tumblr.com/" target="_blank">Emily Gould sort of way</a>, but also it's something I've been experiencing rather frequently.

See:
<ul>
<li><a href="http://morisy.com/review_starbucks_hoffachino">Overly complicated Starbucks drinks</a></li>
<li>Pabst Blue Ribbon beer filling my fridge</li>
<li><i>Entourage</i>, though that's technically something I loved but now hate and still watch</li>
</ul>

The latest thing I'd tumble if given the chance is a podcast. I hate <a href="http://morisy.com/tags/podcasting">podcasts</a>, and know few people who actively seek them out. They're damned inconvenient without an iPod+iTunes, and I find I end up just typing whatever the Podcast host is saying if I try listening to them at work.

But I needed something more productive to listen to than the Black Eyed Pees while running and commuting, and I decided to give <a href="http://rebootnews.com/" target="_blank">Reboot the News</a> a go. I had low expectations judging from the weekly podcast notes, but as I'm going through old episodes, each one has at least a gem that makes the 45-minute listen worth it.

The latest that has me thinking? Focusing on the "<a href="http://rebootnews.com/2009/08/03/00024.html" target="_blank">user of news</a>," which I feel adds a bit of needed utilitarianism to our lofty profession. Hear that episode for yourself here:

Each week (except weeks they take off) Dave Winer, an RSS pioneer and all-around <a href="http://www.scripting.com/" target="_blank">excellent geek blogger</a>, and Jay Rosen, NYU journalism professor and <a href="http://twitter.com/jayrosen_nyu" target="_blank">Twitter gadfly</a>, kick around on re-inventing journalism, and I highly suggest you listen in if that sounds up your alley.

 Anyways, I don't have that Tumblr account, so I'll leave this meme be ... for now.
