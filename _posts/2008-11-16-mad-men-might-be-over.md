Sigh. Sunday's were <i>Mad Men</i> days for me and, er, the rest of the Internet. I even followed a (very) few of the <a href="http://wearesterlingcooper.com/">Sterling Cooper twitterers</a>, though I've more or less cut that out because, while charming, I have enough trouble taking the service seriously with <i>real people</i>, let alone fictional ones.

Now, we have only the above Hulu video, which I thought was one of SNL's best non-political sketches this year ... if you watch <i>Mad Men</i>.

On a side note, I'm going to try to upgrade the site's infrastructure today, so it may or may not be available, these posts may or may not exist, and it may or may not come back zippier and spiffier than ever.
