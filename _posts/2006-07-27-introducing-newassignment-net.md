Jay Rosen has a <a href="http://journalism.nyu.edu/pubzone/weblogs/pressthink/2006/07/25/nadn_qa.html" target="_blank">lengthy, lengthy Q&A</a> on NewAssignment.Net, which, with some VC funds from the likes of <a href="http://www.nowbreaking.com/?p=122" target="_blank">Craig Newmark</a> from Craiglist, hopes to create a New Media/Old Media hybrid. Who isn't these days?

The basic idea is that The Masses create and fine-tune assignments, which will eventually get voted to the front page. Once their, Angel Donors drop dollars to fund a reporter to report, using the Wiki-ized assignment sheet created by The Masses. Full-time, paid Editor/Blogger oversees all of this and pushes things along when necessary, and eventually a story is born.

It's a complicated venture, to say the least.
