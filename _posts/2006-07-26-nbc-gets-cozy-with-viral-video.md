At the risk of sounding like a Media Post shill, they've got a <a href="http://publications.mediapost.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=Articles.san&s=46067&Nid=21978&p=375963" target="_blank">piece</a> up on NBC adding user-submitted video.

Philly's <a href="http://www.nbc10.com" target="_blank">NBC10.com</a> affiliate site supposedly has a "Celebrate Summer" section where users can upload video, but I couldn't find it.

Kinda interesting, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/group/theoffice" target="_blank">given NBC's YouTube advertising ties</a>, recent NBC v. YouTube <a href="http://news.com.com/YouTube+dances+the+copyright+tango/2100-1025_3-6097365.html" target="_blank">legal troubles</a>, and recent NBC / YouTube <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/06/28/business/media/28youtube.html?ex=1309147200&en=b1a9e80df643a659&ei=5088&partner=rssnyt&emc=rss" target="_blank">kiss and make out</a>.

NBC doesn't want an absolute free-for-all however:
<i>Salamone said NBC10 is screening all videos submitted to prevent inappropriate or potentially copyright-infringing material from going up on the site. He added that NBCU is planning to institute a central clearing process to vet user-generated video sent to all of the sites run by its owned stations.</i> -- from the <a href="http://publications.mediapost.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=Articles.san&s=46067&Nid=21978&p=375963" target="_blank">Media Post article</a>.
