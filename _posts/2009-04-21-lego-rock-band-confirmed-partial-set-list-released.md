<blockquote><b>Update:</b> A few more songs from the <a href="http://morisy.com/updated_more_lego_rock_band_set_list_tracks_announced">Lego Rock Band set list are out</a>.</blockquote>

<p> <br>Am I giddily excited? Yes, because Lego Star Wars (minus the tedious flying missions) was one of my favorite DS games, and Guitar Hero: World Tour is probably the Wii game that's garnered the most playtime in my apartment.

Besides, doesn't that picture just want to make you jam out?

According to Shack News, the <a href="http://www.shacknews.com/onearticle.x/58255">set list includes</a>:
<ul>
<li>Pink: "So What" </li>
<li>Good Charlotte: "Boys and Girls"</li>
<li>Europe: "The Final Countdown" </li>
<li>Carl Douglas: "Kung Fu Fighting"</li>
<li>Blur: "Song 2"</li>
</ul>

Even just "The Final Countdown" in Brick-vision is worth the price of admission, particularly since it's compatible with the Wii Guitar Hero controllers.

Final Countdown music video, for your pump-up purposes, after the jump.
