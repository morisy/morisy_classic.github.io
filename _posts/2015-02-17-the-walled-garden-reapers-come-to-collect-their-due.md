<p>It used to be pretty easy to grow an online audience, month-over-month, year-over-year. When I worked managing dozens of bloggers, I even had it down to a rough science: If you write six or more times a month, your audience will almost certainly grow. If you write five or less times a month, your audience almost certainly will decline.</p>
<p>There were exceptions — the truly great and the truly terrible writers could always confound the numbers — but the rule held true for probably 95% of the folks I edited.</p>
<p>But Marco Arment notes something folks are still mostly just whispering about: The days of easy growth are over, and independent blogs might well be the canary in the coal mines.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.marco.org/2015/02/16/google-and-blogs-shit">Via Marco.org</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Shallow social-shareable listicles and clickbait headlines have always been plentiful on the web, but it does seem clear that they’re getting much worse and more dominant recently.</p>
<p>Google is making the problem worse, but they’re not the root problem. In fact, the real problem is a pretty big problem for Google, too:</p>
<p>Everyone’s spending increasingly more consumption time dicking around in apps and snacking on bite-sized social content instead of browsing websites and searching Google.</p>
<p>Publishers are relying more on social traffic not because Google’s squeezing them out, but because that’s where everyone went. The dominance of mobile usage, social networks, and YouTube, plus attention-competition from apps, are the real problems for web publishers and blog writers.</p></blockquote>
<p>While once the web thrived when sites and services pushed their visitors on to other interesting things, the web is becoming much more a series of walled gardens: Traffic from referrers like news organizations or bloggers will go from little to less, while <a href="http://www.niemanlab.org/2015/01/is-publishers-facebook-free-ride-coming-to-a-end/">Facebook, the great traffic driver of the day, is augured by wiser minds</a> to be planning to cut the flow of traffic soon in a bid to keep readers in its own garden.</p>
