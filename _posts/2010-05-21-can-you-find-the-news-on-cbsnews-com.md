CBS Evening News is what many consider a serious news show, but I wouldn't have guessed it looking at an article landing page recently:
<span class="inline inline-center"><a href="http://morisy.com/files/images/findthenews.preview.jpg" onclick="launch_popup(1936, 640, 386); return false;" target="_blank"><img src="http://morisy.com/files/images/findthenews.preview.jpg" alt="" title=""  class="image image-preview " width="640" height="386" /></a></span>
Or more clearly ...
<span class="inline inline-center"><img src="http://morisy.com/files/images/findthenewshighlight.preview.jpg" alt="" title=""  class="image image-preview " width="640" height="386" /></span>

That's a whole <i>80 words of text</i> show up above the digital fold. Count 'em.

Compare this to the gorgeous, content rich NYTimes.com article page:
<span class="inline inline-center"><a href="http://morisy.com/files/images/nytimes.preview.jpg" onclick="launch_popup(1938, 640, 480); return false;" target="_blank"><img src="http://morisy.com/files/images/nytimes.preview.jpg" alt="NYTimes" title="NYTimes"  class="image image-preview " width="640" height="480" /></a></span>

And that was a really good story CBS did, but it's buried under some dreck about Dancing with the Stars, flashing ads, celebrity gossip, say-nothing teaser headlines and Katie Couric's smiling mug, not to mention free ads for Twitter, Digg and Facebook.

Just a shame, that's all.
