I really don't know how I ended up being subscribed to 1369 RSS feeds, but I did. A lot of it is probably Twitter feeds, which I subscribed to using <a href="http://www.scripting.com/stories/2009/08/05/opmlForTwitterDay2.html">Dave Winer's Twitter OPML</a> exporter because I wanted a backup of this stuff.

So when I went to clean up my RSS folders today (how geeky can you get?), using Google Reader's organize function crashed by browser and almost the OS. Reboot, and it barely pulls the page up, but only about a third of it. The rest: The abyss.

In other news, I've been hacking away at <a href="http://www.SpareChangeNews.net">SpareChangeNews.net</a>. Still a long way to go, but we should be rolling out a calendar system (yeah!), slide shows, and more in the next week or so.

Also, most of my blogging is over at <a href="http://itknowledgeexchange.techtarget.com/IT-watch-blog/">ITKnowledgeExchange's IT Watch Blog</a> now, so if tech news is your thing, try over there instead.
