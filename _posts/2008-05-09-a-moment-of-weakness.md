I've held out for years, but after foregoing a new phone, I finally  caved and bought an iPod to console myself. An iPod Touch, no less! After a lifetime of dealing with third-tier MP3 players, I finally have the Cadillac of personal digital media. It plays movies! Music! And it's an <a href="http://www.thebestpageintheuniverse.net/c.cgi?u=iphone" target="_blank">Internet Communications Device</a>!

But seriously, I've wanted exactly that slim Internet tablet-y action for a while now, and since the Nokia N800 is, well, less than consumer ready and even less ready to be taken out for a jog, I guess the locked-down Touch will have to do.
