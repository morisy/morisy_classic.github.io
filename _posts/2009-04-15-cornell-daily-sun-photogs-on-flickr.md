In honor of finally getting images back up and running for the site (trivial file permissions error, once I looked into it), I decided to highlight some of the awesome pictures Daily Sun photographers are posting of Ithaca and beyond. 

I love the image above, which reminds me of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Nighthawks.jpg">Nighthawks</a>, but <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/foreverdigital/">Jenn Vargas</a> and <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/matt_hintsa/">Matt Hintsa</a> both had awesome photostreams as well (Venus' stream <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/sunev/">here</a>).

In addition, Matt created a truly gorgeous photojournalism piece for National Geographic's Glimpse entitled "<a href="http://glimpse.org/stories/view/the-upstanding-citizens-who-rummage-through-my-trash/">The Upstanding Citizens Who Rummage Through My Trash</a>". Definitely worth a look, it chronicles through pictures and text the daily life of one of Santiago's informal recycling trash rummagers.
