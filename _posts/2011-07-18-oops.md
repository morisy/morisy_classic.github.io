Tried upgrading the site to Drupal v 7 tonight, and made a few mistakes (some in full knowledge) while doing it:

<ul>
<li>Backed up nothing, relying on luck and my occasional SQL database dumps</li>
<li>Didn't read the requirements: Drupal 7 needs a later version of PHP than Drupal 6</li>
<li>Randomly deleted and added files when trying to get it to work</li>
<li>Tried and failed at doing an Ubuntu distro upgrade</li>
</ul>

The real show stopper is the PHP requirement, which took me way too long to figure out. Once I did, I tried upgrading my Ubuntu server but it's having trouble extracting the latest update, so I've reverted back to 6.22 and this ugly Garland theme until I have some time to figure out what's going wrong.

The Drupal 7 installation screen, however, looks really nice.

<i><b>Editor's Note:</b> I apologize for calling Garland ugly. It's obviously not, and  Stefan Nagtegaal and Steven Wittens are both incredibly talented designers. It's just the default and not </i>my<i> theme, which is what bugs me. Wittens, by the way, did the wonderful and thought-provoking <a href="http://acko.net/blog/on-termkit">TermKit</a>. Check it out if you're geeky.</i>
