From the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/23/technology/23apps.html">New York Times</a>:
<blockquote><span class="inline inline-right"><img src="http://morisy.com/files/images/bannedapp.jpg" alt="A screenshot from one of On the Go Girls banned applications." title="A screenshot from one of On the Go Girls banned applications."  class="image image-_original " width="190" height="285" /><span class="caption" style="width: 188px;">A screenshot from one of On the Go Girls banned applications.</span></span>Fred Clarke, co-president of a small software company called On the Go Girls, which made Sexy Scratch Off, said that as of Monday all 50 of his company’s applications were no longer available. They included an application in which a woman wearing a swimsuit appeared to wipe finger marks from the iPhone’s screen with a rag and spray bottle.

“I’m shocked,” said Mr. Clarke, who said the company had not had a problem with its applications since the first one went on sale last June. “We’re showing stuff that’s racier than the Disney Channel, but not by much.”

Mr. Clarke said his company had been earning thousands of dollars a day from the App Store.

“It’s very hard to go from making a good living to zero,” he said. “This goes farther than sexy content. For developers, how do you know you aren’t going to invest thousands into a business only to find out one day you’ve been cut off?”</blockquote>

How long until developers start picking platforms they can't get kicked off? Until the risk is greater than the reward, which means "really soon" for anyone who wants anything more provocative than sparkly unicorns in their app. And it's not a new or even particularly shocking phenomenon, since <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/apple/5982243/Apple-bans-dictionary-from-App-Store-over-swear-words.html">Apple's previously banished dictionaries</a>.

The strangest part is that this is all on the device with a beautifully crafted browser that can, you know, browse the great smut basin that is the Internet.
