After the L.A. Times' hastily withdrawn <a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/opinion/editorials/la-wiki-splash,0,1349109.htmlstory"  target="_blank">wiki editorial</a>, few imagined papers would tread that path again. But tread they did, though perhaps using the wisdom of the masses a bit more wisely to collate data rather than to form an opinion on said data.

Ben Smith's political blog, <a href="http://blogs.nydailynews.com/dailypolitics/" target="_blank">The Daily Politics</a>, got tired of not having one regularly updated, definitive source on where various New York State Assembly members stood on gay marriage. So Smith created and <a href="http://blogs.nydailynews.com/dailypolitics/archives/2006/07/post_18.php" target="_blank">spotlighted</a> the wiki, which is available <a href="http://scratchpad.wikia.com/wiki/AssemblyOnMarriage" target="_blank">here</a>.

So far, even with the wisdom of the collective masses, only 30 out of 150 members have been pinned down.

The vast majority of the edits <a href="http://scratchpad.wikia.com/index.php?title=AssemblyOnMarriage&action=history" target="_blank">appear</a> to have been done by Smith himself.
