Just when I made it big enough to get comment spam, I've decided to close up shop. Working 50 hours a week as Managing Editor plus being a full-time student, investigative reporter and aspiring job applicant just leaves no time for this pursuit.

If I ever get a free couple of days, I'll redo this so it's more of a resume/clip book site, with maybe some interesting links scrolling around. Til then, enjoy the scant archives and feel free to leave advertisments for Cialis.

One last link however: In a year's time, something along <a href="http://www.fastcompany.com/subscr/110/open_hyper-local-hero.html" target="_blank">these lines</a> is what I hope to be doing.

Best,
 Michael
