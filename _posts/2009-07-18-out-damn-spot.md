By day, I primarily wear the "journalist" hat, but lately I've gotten involved with Spare Change News as a volunteer on the Development Committee. I'm sure I'll be writing more about them in the future, but suffice to say Spare Change is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Street_newspaper">street newspaper</a> that's designed to be an accessible form of self-employment for homeless or formerly homeless individuals.

I was asked to help re-design their website:
<span class="inline inline-center"><a href="http://www.morisy.com/files/images/SpareChangeNews.jpg" onclick="launch_popup(151, 430, 611); return false;" target="_blank"><img src="http://www.morisy.com/files/images/SpareChangeNews.jpg" alt="1994 called, they want their tables back." title="1994 called, they want their tables back."  class="image image-preview " width="430" height="611" /></a></span>


So I'm working on the re-design which is going swimmingly and forcing me to work a bit more on <a href="/instant_makeover_morisycom_redesigned">Instant Design</a>, but while I've found an excellent <a href="http://www.digifuzz.net/archives/2008/06/suckerfish-style-menus-in-drupal-6x/" target="_blank">Drupal drop-down menu tutorial</a>, I can't get rid of the damn unordered list bullet stylings, despite using the style: blank; tag or whatever it is.

The result is not pretty:
<span class="inline inline-center"><img src="http://www.morisy.com/files/images/spot.jpg" alt="Spot" title="Spot"  class="image image-_original " width="345" height="220" /><span class="caption"><strong>Spot</strong></span></span>

And that's why you're getting this wonky design rant rather than a post on SEO for journalists, like I've been planning for weeks.
