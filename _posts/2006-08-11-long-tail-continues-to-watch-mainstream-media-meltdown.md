Chris Anderson's Long Tail has an analysis of how various mass media are faring -- and <a href="http://www.longtail.com/the_long_tail/2006/08/mainstream_medi.html" target="_blank">it doesn't look good</a>.

How much of print journalism's current woes stem from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_tail" target="_blank">Long Tail economics</a> is up for debate, but a tendency towards concentrating on local over national stories in local media suggests that editors and publishers are responding to the trends.

Anderson's post also suggests that papers are not alone in their struggles to retain customers in the internet age. TV, radio, music and DVDs are all "down."
