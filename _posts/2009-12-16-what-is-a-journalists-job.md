There's a great post by Jeff Atwood on the <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000962.html">importance of elevator pitch test</a> out of which I snip the following: <blockquote>Software developers think their job is writing code. But it's not.* Their job is to solve the customer's problem. Sure, our preferred medium for solving problems is software, and that does involve writing code. But let's keep this squarely in context: writing code is something you have to do to deliver a solution. It is not an end in and of itself. </blockquote>

Tweaked slightly:
<blockquote><b>Journalists</b> think their job is writing <b>articles</b>. But it's not.* Their job is to solve the <b>reader</b>'s problem. Sure, our <b>*formerly*</b> preferred medium for solving problems is <b>the article</b>, and that does involve writing <del>code</del>. But let's keep this squarely in context: writing <del>code</del> is something you have to do to deliver a solution. It is not an end in and of itself. </blockquote>
