Media Life Magazine <a href="http://www.medialifemagazine.com/artman/publish/article_6023.asp" target="_blank">reports</a> that many business mags (including Forbes, Fortune, Money and BusinessWeek) are recouping some lost profits as web-centric strategies start to pay off with advertisers. Since many of these users are checking the sites throughout the day, the magazines have pushed more analysis and features into the print, with more hard news on the web.

BusinessWeek president Bill Kupper told reporter Samantha Melamed:

<ul>
<li>Ad revenues online were up 80 percent in the first quarter.</li>
<li>Visits online are up 74 percent through May.</li>
<li>New mantra is platform agnostic.
<li>"The new way to launch a print publication is to launch it online first and test it."</li>
</ul>

The article has a great chart outlining the number of visitors and the time the spend on a typical session.
