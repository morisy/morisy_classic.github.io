My old college pal Charlie from Ohio offers up insightful analysis, as always:
<blockquote>
Isn't Bush right now like a college kid going through terminal senioritis? I imagine Obama like the newly appointed frat president, being given a tour of this wreck of a house by this bumbling, stumbling hungover kid who can't wait to be out of college and that state's jurisdiction.

And what's happening today is that Bush is letting Obama know that the frat is on probation, the alumni base is incensed because of stories leaked to the campus paper and is threatening to withhold donations, and that no sorority will have a mixer with them because everyone in the house is too damned sleazy.
