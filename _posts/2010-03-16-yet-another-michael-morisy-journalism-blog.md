<span class="inline inline-right"><img src="http://morisy.com/files/images/old-newspapers.thumbnail.jpg" alt="" title=""  class="image image-thumbnail " width="100" height="89" /></span>In addition to here and <a href="http://itknowledgeexchange.techtarget.com/IT-watch-blog/">the IT Watch Blog</a>, I'm now blogging at <a href="http://muckrock.com/blog/">MuckRock</a>, a site dedicated to web-enabled citizen journalism tools. I'll be writing about, er, citizen journalism, freedom of information laws, and any other little thing that strikes my fancy.
