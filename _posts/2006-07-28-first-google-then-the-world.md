I've won the <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=morisy&btnG=Google+Search" target="_blank">Google love</a>, but <a href="http://search.yahoo.com/search?p=morisy&ei=UTF-8&rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&fr=moz3" target="_blank">even my dad Yahoo!'s better</a>. At least <a href="http://www.live.com/?q=morisy" target="_blank">Microsoft live likes me</a>, though Technorati doesn't even know I exist. Sigh.
