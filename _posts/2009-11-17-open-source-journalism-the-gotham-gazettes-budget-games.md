Gail Robinson, editor in chief of the Gotham Gazette, and <a href="http://www.pbs.org/idealab/amanda_hickman/">Amanda Hickman</a> are two of my new journalism heroes. With a Knight Foundation grant, they've been creating a series of news games, which they're in the process of open sourcing. <a href="http://www.gothamgazette.com/article/gamesandquizzes/20090928/201/3038">Switch</a> is kind of a basic game that has players pick cards at random until they can successfully match them, Memory-style. 

<a href="http://www.gothamgazette.com/article/gamesandquizzes/20090209/201/2822">Balance!</a>, however, is a bit more interesting: It lets players try to balance NYC's ominous budget through the downturn, and compare their results with Mayor Bloomberg's. Users can then submit their budgets, providing a quick, graphical way to understand the sacrifices being made, and outlining some of the basic challenges with cutting each area.

The Flash game is open source and <a href="http://github.com/GothamGazette/Balance">available on Git Hub</a>, and Amanda's promised that other journalism games will also be posted there in the future.
