Ok, first a disclaimer: This pizza has 10 gazillion calories and it probably won't save money over ordering. It tastes incredible, however, so I still think you'll end up ahead.

<b>Ingredients:</b> 
<ul>
<li>Half a pound of crumbled blue cheese</li>
<li>A pound of 80/20 ground beef</li>
<li>8 slices of bacon</li>
<li>A pound of pre-made pizza dough, I used Trader Joe's</li>
<li>Barbecue sauce. I recommend Corky's if you can get it.</li>
</ul>

<b>Recipe</b>
<ol>
<li>Stick the bacon in the microwave for 8 minutes, on a plate. Sandwich the bacon in between two sheets of paper towels that have had water sprinkled on them.</li>
<li>While that's microwaving, start cooking up the ground beef in a pan, adding garlic, salt, papper and some barbecue sauce. Cook until thoroughly brown.</li>
<li>Roll out the pizza dough onto whatever you'll be cooking it on. I used a pizza stone.</li>
<li>Start pre-heating the oven to 350&deg;.</li>
<li>Sprinkle a (un)healthy layer of blue cheese on the dough.</li>
<li>Cover the the blue cheese with the the pound of ground beef.</li>
<li>Layer down bacon on top of the ground beef, and then drizzle with more barbecue sauce.</li>
<li>Sprinkle remaining blue cheese on top.</li>
<li>Bake for 12 minutes and then check on it until the crust is a golden brown.</li>
<li>Cut, let sit for a few minutes and serve.</li>
