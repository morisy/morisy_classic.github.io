I've been paying a lot more attention to welcome e-mails lately, and this one did a great job of mixing an informal tone with useful information to quickly get you in and going.

Here's the e-mail:

Hi there, new WorkFlowy user!

Mike and Jesse, creators of WorkFlowy, here. WorkFlowy is a super-powerful tool that's going to clear your mind, hone your focus, increase your productivity, and bring peace to the Middle East. (We'll get back to you on the last one.)

**What should you be using WorkFlowy for?**

WorkFlowy is a single sheet of paper to hold your whole brain. The idea: put EVERYTHING you want to keep track of into it. Notes about your trip to Tahiti, stuff you need to get done in the next week, a list of your favorite Transylvanian romance novels, your Ph.D. thesis outline - they're all fair game.

If you haven't already, might we suggest you get started? Do it right now, before you forget.

Here's what you should do:

* Go to workflowy.com.
* Create top-level items called 'Personal' and 'Work'.
* Click the bullet point next to 'Personal' to zoom in.
  * Create a 'Chores' item. List under it everything you need to do in the next week.
  * Create a 'Goals' item. List under it everything you want to get done in the next month and year.
* Zoom out and start on the 'Work' section.

This should be enough to get you started. WorkFlowy is free-form and you can use it however you like.

We'll be getting back to you with more info on WorkFlowy's features. For now, check out the 'Help' popup to learn more. And don't hesitate to contact us at help@workflowy.com with questions.

Rock on,
Mike and Jesse
