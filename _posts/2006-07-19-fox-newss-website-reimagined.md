Not exactly new (says it was posted May 22, but I think it's older), Andy Rutledge has a rather lengthy <a href="http://www.andyrutledge.com/fox-news-redux.php" target="_blank">critique</a> of Fox News's website. He says his critique is in no way "a viable redesign effort beyond the specifics cited."

However, he does offer a lot of free advice:
<ul><li>Make sure content doesn't look like ads.</li>
<li>Go for clear, not cramped.</li>
<li>Keep links clearly marked and consistent.</li>
<li>Use a well-kept horizontal grid to avoid clutter.</li>
</ul>

No recap does his analysis justice, especially lacking the screen shots and mock ups Rutledge includes. Get it all <a href="http://www.andyrutledge.com/fox-news-redux.php" target="_blank">here</a>.
