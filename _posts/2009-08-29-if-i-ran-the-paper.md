<a href="http://gangrey.com/2178">Ben's post</a> just reminded me too much of my time at the New York Daily News to not play along. And like he said, "I'm awake. What the hell."

<ul>
<li>Whiskey at every desk. Editor's drink Scotch. Senior editors, gin.</li>
<li>Anonymous sources get code names. I had one frequent source go as X for 2 years.</li>
<li>Dumpster diving for source material should be a quarterly exercise, with a cold beer back at the office for de-briefing.</li>
<li>The above should have a flimsy legal justification the managing editor is unwilling to run by legal.</ii>
<li>News boys have a strict dress code of rags and proper headware, as pictured above.</li>
<li>Run a picture twice as big as your common sense tells you to. Then make it bigger</li>
<li>If a story's important, make the cover it runs on something people will want to collect.</li>
<li>If a story's not important, don't run it.</li>
<li><b>Always be the bulldog for your readers.</b></ii>
<li>Have at least 3 solid enemies: A prominent politician, a rival publication and a shifty restaurant. Campaign against them mercilessly until they clean up or close up. All should know you, and there heart quicken at the mention of your name.</li>
</ul>
