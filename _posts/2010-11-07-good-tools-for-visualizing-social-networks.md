It was a great database, but a little hard to wrap your head around because you had to do a search on an official or a company, which meant knowing where to start.

It was also difficult to get a "big picture" look at just how interwoven everything actually was. The month before, I'd been approached to pitch a similar project, that would map the ties between contractors and state officials in a way similar to how <a href="http://muckety.com/">Muckety.com graphs political, business and social relationships</a>.

I haven't had a chance to play with many options, but thought I'd collect them here and share my impressions as I get a chance.

<ul>
<li><b><a href="http://my.muckety.com/">My.Muckety.com</a></b> is in beta, is free and puts out some nice looking social graphs. You plot out the relationships in a Google Doc, upload it, and they map it for you. As far as I can tell, the free accounts are limited to one graph at a time, with up to a hundred nodes, but there's no option yet to upgrade to a pro account or anything else that would give you more access.</li>
<li>IBM's <b><a href="http://www-958.ibm.com/software/data/cognos/manyeyes/">Many Eyes</a></b> project has quickly become the data visualization/crowd sourcing darling: Upload a data set, and let the world play and poke at it. It features social graphs, like <a href="http://www-958.ibm.com/software/data/cognos/manyeyes/visualizations/co-occurrences-of-names-in-the-new-3">this one of Biblical  co-occurrences</a>, as one of the many, many options. I believe it's currently free and mostly a way for IBM to show off what their BI tool Cognos can do.</li>
<li><b><a href="http://socnetv.sourceforge.net/">SocNetV</a></b> is an open-source social grapher that has some neat tools like a built-in webcrawler.</li>
<li><b><a href="http://www.analytictech.com/ucinet/">UCINET</a></b> has a free time-expiring demo, and paid rates ranging from $40 to $250 for a full license.</li>
<li><b><a href="http://www.graphviz.org/">GraphViz</a></b> is another open source option. The homepage says it can power web graphs, apparently through the <a href="http://www2.research.att.com/~john/Grappa/grappa1_2.html">Grappa</a> Java engine</li>
<li><b><a href="http://nodexl.codeplex.com/">NodeXL</a></b> is an Excel template that makes it easy to power social graphing without much out of the ordinary software. It uses an OSI-approved open source license. There's also a <a href="http://casci.umd.edu/images/4/46/NodeXL_tutorial_draft.pdf">free tutorial for it</a> as well.</li>
<li><b><a href="http://flare.prefuse.org/">Flare</a></b> is a nice Flash ActionScript library that looks like it could easily create dozens of varieties of social graph visualizations with just a few clicks. The <a href="http://flare.prefuse.org/demo">demo is incredibly smooth and impressive</a>, and it's also open source.</li>
<li><b><a href="http://gephi.org/">Gephi</a></b> is another slick network visualization package, but doesn't appear to have a web component. </li>
<li><b><a href="http://vis.stanford.edu/protovis/">Protovis</a></b> is another open source option that sports in vogue favorites like force-directed diagrams and <a href="http://vis.stanford.edu/protovis/ex/">many, many other options</a>. Here's a <a href="http://multimedia.journalism.berkeley.edu/tutorials/protovis-javascript-charts-part-1/">guide</a>.</li> 
</ul>

And not technically a software package, but Investigative Reporters and Editors has a <a href="http://www.ire.org/sna/">social network analysis guide</a>. Any other options I've missed? Add them below in the comments. As I get time to test out the various packages, I'll post my thoughts and link to them from here.

<i>Note: Many of these great suggestions come straight from the NICAR mailing list.</i>
