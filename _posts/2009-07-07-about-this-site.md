Since I registered it on April 20th, 2005, <a href="http://www.morisy.com/">Morisy.com</a> has been my home page on the web. Also since pretty much that date, it's been powered by <a href="http://www.drupal.org" target="_blank">Drupal</a>, my content management system (CMS) of choice. It's not the easiest platform, particularly for beginners, and I wouldn't recommended it for a simple blog platform, but it's an incredibly powerful open source tool if you're willing to dive in and learn a little PHP, CSS and web server configuration.

I recently moved from the Chameleon theme to a custom theme, called Instant Design, that I wrote myself. It's a work in progress, but when it's portable enough I'll upload it here in case anyone else is interested. It's based on the BlueprintCSS framework and the excellent <a href="http://drupal.org/project/blueprint">BlueprintCSS Drupal port</a>, without which I would've been sorely stuck. If you really like the theme, <a href="/contact">let me know</a> and I'll hurry up on getting it ready for public consumption.

The site is hosted by <a href="http://www.morisy.com" target="_blank">MXHub.com</a>, a company I've been using since the site launched. Their support has continuously improved, as has their up time, and I highly recommend them if you have modest hosting needs like my own.

As of this writing, I average slightly over a hundred unique visitors a day. May 21st, 2009 was the site's most popular day on (Google Analytics) record, with 1,403 unique visitors.
