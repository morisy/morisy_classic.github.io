There's been a lot of discussion about whether Flash deserves its place on the web, and whether it should keep that place. Apple says it shouldn't, that it crashes their computers and breaks the "open web" and drains batteries and drowns kittens, which is all undoubtedly 100% true-ish. But try browsing around the web for a week without Flash, and you'll get used to not listening to streaming music or watching YouTube videos and generally being more productive, because entertainment-y sties like the above won't even let you view their content without a plugin because there's no way to get rid of their stupid pop-ups, even though I can't view them in the first place.

Come to think of it, maybe removing Flash from every computer, everywhere, is the perfect antidote to the recession. Productivity would skyrocket. Steve Jobs <i>is</i> a genius.
