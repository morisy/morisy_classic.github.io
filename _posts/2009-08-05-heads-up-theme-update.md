I'm bringing the <a href="http://www.morisy.com">Morisy.com</a> design up to the latest version of <a href="http://morisy.com/tags/instant_design">Instant Design</a>. Overall it's not too drastic a change, but some images will likely break for a bit and the front page will require some heavy lifting. I've mostly been prepping it over at <a href="http://www.sparechangenews.net/beta" target="_blank">Spare Change News</a>, which has forced me to get rid of much of the Morisy-specific cruft.

Also, it'll introduce drop-down menus. Let me know if you hate it in the comments!
