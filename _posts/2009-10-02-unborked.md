Recently, I've fallen in love with a number of web widgets:
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.feedly.com/">Feedly</a>, which if you use Firefox and Google Reader, makes both so, so much better</li>
<li><a href="http://www.google.com/sidewiki/intl/en/index.html">Google SideWiki</a>, which is much ado about nothing</li>
<li><a href="http://drupal.org/project/admin_menu">Drupal Admin Menu</a>, which makes administering a Drupal site much, much more fun</li>
</ul>
Unfortunately, all three of these extensions muck around with how HTML is displayed, and  ultimately they removed the ability to post articles on my website. Sure, I could have used another computer, or even another browser but ...

Anyways, those issues have been fixed, since I ultimately tossed Admin Menu since it was the lowest hanging fruit. Google Wiki is next to go since it's a waste so far, and Feedly is firmly here to stay until someone else does it more openly and better.

I still won't be blogging here much, but I do blog pretty much every weekday over at the <a href="http://itknowledgeexchange.techtarget.com/IT-watch-blog/">IT Watch Blog</a>. I don't know why I chose that name, but come on over: We're a fun crowd.
