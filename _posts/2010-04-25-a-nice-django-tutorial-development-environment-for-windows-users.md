Python was the second programming language I learned, and I recently wanted to brush up again on my Django (a development framework for Python that makes it easier to build up full-fledge web apps). Getting Django to work on a Windows machine turned out to be almost as big a task as getting something to run in it, however ... until I came across <a href="http://www.instantdjango.com/">Instant Django</a>, which packages everything you need to build Django applications in a nice, portable, tidy bundle. You can take your development environment around on a Flash drive!

The site also has a great tutorial up on using the packages and making a (very very very basic) EveryBlock clone. If you're looking to jump into Django, no programming experience necessary, give <a href="http://www.instantdjango.com/">Instant Django a try</a>.
