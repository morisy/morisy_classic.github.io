BusinessWeek <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/technology/content/aug2006/tc20060803_714787.htm?chan=technology_technology+index+page_internet" target="_blank">keeps bringing up</a> MySpace and Facebook when discussing the purchase, though no social networking implementation has been (yet) announced.

Other plans are hinted at, however:<i>
<blockquote>
The deal is likely to help boost growth at Y2M. The company will have access to mtvU's 120 major advertisers, as well as some new content and Web functionality from MTV. "We're looking forward to supporting them with new tools and advertising opportunities, empowering them to expand their offerings and audience as well as improve their financial performance," said Stephen Friedman, general manager of mtvU.</i>
</blockquote>
Streaming MTV video on news sites? Can <a href="http://www.poynter.org/column.asp?id=45&aid=105620" target="_blank">sponsored headlines</a> be far away as markets seek to reach that vaunted 20s demographic in any way possible?
