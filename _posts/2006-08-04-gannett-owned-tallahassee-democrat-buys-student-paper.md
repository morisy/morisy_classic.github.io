The <a href="http://www.fsunews.com/" target="_blank">FSView & Florida Flambeau</a> was recently purchased by the nearby Tallahassee Democrat, Inside HigherEd <a href="http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2006/08/03/gannett" target="_blank">reports</a>.

From their article:
<i>Media observers say this is the first time that a major newspaper chain has purchased an independent, privately owned publication that is geared toward students, faculty and administrators. The Flambeau has been independent since 1971. The then-floundering newspaper merged with FSView in 1998, and the publication has a circulation of about 25,000 readers during the academic year.</i>

The article also mentions that Gannett approached the paper regarding the sale, and that the "current pay scale" at the paper would remain in place.

Romenesko readers <a href="http://poynter.org/forum/view_post.asp?id=11689" target="_blank">quibble</a> over whether the sale truly is a "first" for a student paper to be purchased in this manner.
