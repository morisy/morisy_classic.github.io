Running a script to pull data for a story I'm working on, my terminal produced the following which I liked a lot:

<pre>
Increment the occurrences for Poison to a total of 1
starting on next keyword, Journalists
Set a blank slate of years
starting on next keyword, blackmail
Set a blank slate of years
starting on next keyword, scandal
Set a blank slate of years
starting on next keyword, assassination
Set a blank slate of years
starting on next keyword, hersh
Set a blank slate of years
All done
</pre>
